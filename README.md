# Food-Inventory-Management-System
This is the first project I made back into the Summer in 2020. The website aims to keep track of the expiry date of the food and allow users to view and remove the records. 
I was a newbie at that time and the code is quite messy (the libraries and syntaxes are outdated as well).
However, it works and it is one of my milestones so I just leave this here as a record of my programming journey ðŸ˜„.

**This project is not maintained anymore and is replaced by my other mobile app project - `Food-Inventory-Management-System-2.0`!**

## Features
- Upload/View/Remove record
- QR code scanner
- Date Input

## Getting Started
It is not recommended to run this project. You can check out the screenshots and descriptions in [this 1-minute video](https://youtu.be/gExLkWf5DCg).  
However, if you insists, please take a look at the following instructions:
- The project is programmed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
- You need a server (e.g. XAMPP) to run this project.
- A database with following requirements need to be made for the project to work.
  - database name: food_inventory
  - table name: Item
  - attributes: currentTime (Integer), barcode (Integer), quantity (Integer), expiryDate (Time)
